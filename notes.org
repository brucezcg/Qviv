** Scaling and zooming
[[scale-and-offset.svg]]

  - Since QImage does not support scaling and cropping in one atomic command this must be done in the following two commands:
    - scale the s_copy_w area by the scale factor
    - copy and crop while ignoring the red areas.
* <2011-05-16 Mon>
** Done
   - Fixed repaint bug that stopped scrolling from working.
   - Added mouse scroll event and keyboards event.
   - Added several more zoom functions from gtkimageviewer.
** Bugs
   - [ ] There is an offset bug visible at high zoom ratios. Probably due to an error in the calculation of offsets in paintEvent.
** Todo
   - [ ] Figure out how to support scroll bars.
   - [ ] Check if empty canvas without underlying image works.
   - [ ] Start working overlay.
